Welcome to Ruocheng Guo's homepage.

I am a Ph.D. student @ Arizona State University, now I am affiliated [Data Mining and Machine Learning Lab](http://dmml.asu.edu/) @ ASU, under supervision of [Prof. Huan Liu](http://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/).

Before joining ASU, I received M.Sc degree in Electronic Engineering from the most beautiful Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in Hong Kong, China and B.Eng degree in Electrical Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China.

My most interested research topics are Machine Learning, Causal Inference and Social Media Mining.
