Several months back, while reading [1], I started to realize the problem of MLE. Writing my new paper where I need to specify drawbacks of MLE for TPP, I went through this paper again and think it is valuable to take some notes.
As mentioned in this paper, MLE is equivalent to minimize the KL divergence between the real data distribution (Pr) and the generator's distribution (Pg).
