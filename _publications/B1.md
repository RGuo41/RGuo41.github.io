collection: publications

excerpt: 'In recent years, research on diffusion process in social networks has grown in a
variety of fields including computer science, physics, and biology. However, often
times research in these individual disciplines becomes stove-piped. In this book,
we focus on cutting-edge research in social network diffusion bringing together a
range of ideas from these disciplines with the goal of creating a single volume that
examines these ideas.
We sought to cover many of the most important concepts, models, and methods
from these areas. We felt by exploring a variety of work from different fields that
we could help open the door to more innovative findings in this fascinating area of
diffusion in social networks.'
